# <a name="queries-visual-basic"></a>查询 (Visual Basic)
Visual Basic enables you to create [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](~/includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] expressions in your code.  
  
## <a name="in-this-section"></a>本节内容  
 [Aggregate 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/aggregate-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Aggregate` clause, which applies one or more aggregate functions to a collection.  
  
 [Distinct 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/distinct-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Distinct` clause, which restricts the values of the current range variable to eliminate duplicate values in query results.  
  
 [From 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/from-clause.md)  
 Describes the `From` clause, which specifies a collection and a range variable for a query.  
  
 [Group By 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-by-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Group By` clause, which groups the elements of a query result and can be used to apply aggregate functions to each group.  
  
 [Group Join 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-join-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Group Join` clause, which combines two collections into a single hierarchical collection.  
  
 [Join 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/join-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Join` clause, which combines two collections into a single collection.  
  
 [Let 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/let-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Let` clause, which computes a value and assigns it to a new variable in the query.  
  
 [Order By 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/order-by-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Order By` clause, which specifies the sort order for columns in a query.  
  
 [Select 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/select-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Select` clause, which declares a set of range variables for a query.  
  
 [Skip 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/skip-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Skip` clause, which bypasses a specified number of elements in a collection and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
 [Skip While 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/skip-while-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Skip While` clause, which bypasses elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is `true` and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
 [Take 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/take-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Take` clause, which returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a collection.  
  
 [Take While 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/take-while-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Take While` clause, which includes elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is `true` and bypasses the remaining elements.  
  
 [Where 子句](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/where-clause.md)  
 Describes the `Where` clause, which specifies a filtering condition for a query.
