# <a name="comparison-operators-visual-basic"></a>比较运算符 (Visual Basic)
The following are the comparison operators defined in Visual Basic.

 `<` operator

 `<=` operator

 `>` operator

 `>=` operator

 `=` operator

 `<>` operator

 [Is 运算符](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)

 [IsNot 运算符](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md)

 [Like 运算符](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/like-operator.md)

 These operators compare two expressions to determine whether or not they are equal, and if not, how they differ. `Is`, `IsNot`, and `Like` are discussed in detail on separate Help pages. The relational comparison operators are discussed in detail on this page.

## <a name="syntax"></a>语法
  
```vb
result = expression1 comparisonoperator expression2  
result = object1 [Is | IsNot] object2  
result = string Like pattern  
```  
  
## <a name="parts"></a>部件
 `result`  
 必须的。 A `Boolean` value representing the result of the comparison.

 `expression1`，`expression2`  
 必须的。 任何表达式。

 `comparisonoperator`  
 必须的。 Any relational comparison operator.

 `object1`，`object2`  
 必须的。 Any reference object names.

 `string`  
 必须的。 任何 `String` 表达式。

 `pattern`  
 必须的。 Any `String` expression or range of characters.

## <a name="remarks"></a>备注
 The following table contains a list of the relational comparison operators and the conditions that determine whether `result` is `True` or `False`.

|运算符|`True` 是否|`False` 是否|
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
|`<` (Less than)|`expression1` < `expression2`|`expression1` >= `expression2`|
|`<=` (Less than or equal to)|`expression1` <= `expression2`|`expression1` > `expression2`|
|`>` (Greater than)|`expression1` > `expression2`|`expression1` <= `expression2`|
|`>=` (Greater than or equal to)|`expression1` >= `expression2`|`expression1` < `expression2`|
|`=` (Equal to)|`expression1` = `expression2`|`expression1` <> `expression2`|
|`<>` (Not equal to)|`expression1` <> `expression2`|`expression1` = `expression2`|

> [!NOTE]
> The [= Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/assignment-operator.md) is also used as an assignment operator.

 The `Is` operator, the `IsNot` operator, and the `Like` operator have specific comparison functionalities that differ from the operators in the preceding table.

## <a name="comparing-numbers"></a>Comparing Numbers
 When you compare an expression of type `Single` to one of type `Double`, the `Single` expression is converted to `Double`. This behavior is opposite to the behavior found in Visual Basic 6.

 Similarly, when you compare an expression of type `Decimal` to an expression of type `Single` or `Double`, the `Decimal` expression is converted to `Single` or `Double`. For `Decimal` expressions, any fractional value less than 1E-28 might be lost. Such fractional value loss may cause two values to compare as equal when they are not. For this reason, you should take care when using equality (`=`) to compare two floating-point variables. It is safer to test whether the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers is less than a small acceptable tolerance.

### <a name="floating-point-imprecision"></a>Floating-point Imprecision
 When you work with floating-point numbers, keep in mind that they do not always have a precise representation in memory. This could lead to unexpected results from certain operations, such as value comparison and the [Mod Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/mod-operator.md). For more information, see [Troubleshooting Data Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/troubleshooting-data-types.md).

## <a name="comparing-strings"></a>比较字符串
 When you compare strings, the string expressions are evaluated based on their alphabetical sort order, which depends on the `Option Compare` setting.

 `Option Compare Binary` bases string comparisons on a sort order derived from the internal binary representations of the characters. The sort order is determined by the code page. The following example shows a typical binary sort order.

 `A < B < E < Z < a < b < e < z < À < Ê < Ø < à < ê < ø`

 `Option Compare Text` bases string comparisons on a case-insensitive, textual sort order determined by your application's locale. When you set `Option Compare Text` and sort the characters in the preceding example, the following text sort order applies:

 `(A=a) < (À= à) < (B=b) < (E=e) < (Ê= ê) < (Ø = ø) < (Z=z)`

### <a name="locale-dependence"></a>Locale Dependence
 When you set `Option Compare Text`, the result of a string comparison can depend on the locale in which the application is running. Two characters might compare as equal in one locale but not in another. If you are using a string comparison to make important decisions, such as whether to accept an attempt to log on, you should be alert to locale sensitivity. Consider either setting `Option Compare Binary` or calling the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.StrComp%2A>, which takes the locale into account.

## <a name="typeless-programming-with-relational-comparison-operators"></a>Typeless Programming with Relational Comparison Operators
 The use of relational comparison operators with `Object` expressions is not allowed under `Option Strict On`. When `Option Strict` is `Off`, and either `expression1` or `expression2` is an `Object` expression, the run-time types determine how they are compared. The following table shows how the expressions are compared and the result from the comparison, depending on the runtime type of the operands.

|If operands are|Comparison is|
|---------------------|-------------------|
|Both `String`|Sort comparison based on string sorting characteristics.|
|Both numeric|Objects converted to `Double`, numeric comparison.|
|One numeric and one `String`|The `String` is converted to a `Double` and numeric comparison is performed. If the `String` cannot be converted to `Double`, an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> is thrown.|
|Either or both are reference types other than `String`|引发 <xref:System.InvalidCastException>。|

 Numeric comparisons treat `Nothing` as 0. String comparisons treat `Nothing` as `""` (an empty string).

## <a name="overloading"></a>重载
 The relational comparison operators (`<`. `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<>`) can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine their behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses any of these operators on such a class or structure, be sure you understand the redefined behavior. 有关更多信息，请参见 [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)。

 Notice that the [= Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/assignment-operator.md) can be overloaded only as a relational comparison operator, not as an assignment operator.

## <a name="example"></a>示例
 The following example shows various uses of relational comparison operators, which you use to compare expressions. Relational comparison operators return a `Boolean` result that represents whether or not the stated expression evaluates to `True`. When you apply the `>` and `<` operators to strings, the comparison is made using the normal alphabetical sorting order of the strings. This order can be dependent on your locale setting. Whether the sort is case-sensitive or not depends on the [Option Compare](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-compare-statement.md) setting.

 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOperators/VB/Class1.vb#1)]

 In the preceding example, the first comparison returns `False` and the remaining comparisons return `True`.
