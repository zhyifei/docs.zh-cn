# <a name="program-structure-and-code-conventions-visual-basic"></a>程序结构和代码约定 (Visual Basic)
This section introduces the typical Visual Basic program structure, provides a simple Visual Basic program, "Hello, World", and discusses Visual Basic code conventions. Code conventions are suggestions that focus not on a program's logic but on its physical structure and appearance. Following them makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Code conventions can include, among others:  
  
- Standardized formats for labeling and commenting code.  
  
- Guidelines for spacing, formatting, and indenting code.  
  
- Naming conventions for objects, variables, and procedures.  
  
 The following topics present a set of programming guidelines for Visual Basic programs, along with examples of good usage.  
  
## <a name="in-this-section"></a>本节内容  
 [Structure of a Visual Basic Program](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/structure-of-a-visual-basic-program.md)  
 Provides an overview of the elements that make up a Visual Basic program.  
  
 [Main Procedure in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/main-procedure.md)  
 Discusses the procedure that serves as the starting point and overall control for your application.  
  
 [引用和 Imports 语句](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/references-and-the-imports-statement.md)  
 Discusses how to reference objects in other assemblies.  
  
 [Namespaces in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/namespaces.md)  
 Describes how namespaces organize objects within assemblies.  
  
 [Visual Basic Naming Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/naming-conventions.md)  
 Includes general guidelines for naming procedures, constants, variables, arguments, and objects.  
  
 [Visual Basic 编码约定](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/coding-conventions.md)  
 Reviews the guidelines used in developing the samples in this documentation.  
  
 [条件编译](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/conditional-compilation.md)  
 Describes how to compile particular blocks of code selectively while directing the compiler to ignore others.  
  
 [如何：在代码中拆分和合并语句](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)  
 Shows how to divide long statements into multiple lines and combine short statements on one line.  
  
 [如何：折叠和隐藏代码节](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-collapse-and-hide-sections-of-code.md)  
 Shows how to collapse and hide sections of code in the Visual Basic code editor.  
  
 [如何：标记语句](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-label-statements.md)  
 Shows how to mark a line of code to identify it for use with statements such as `On Error Goto`.  
  
 [代码中的特殊字符](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/special-characters-in-code.md)  
 Shows how and where to use non-numeric and non-alphabetic characters.  
  
 [代码中的注释](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/comments-in-code.md)  
 Discusses how to add descriptive comments to your code.  
  
 [代码中用作元素名称的关键字](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/keywords-as-element-names-in-code.md)  
 Describes how to use brackets (`[]`) to delimit variable names that are also Visual Basic keywords.  
  
 [Me、My、MyBase 和 MyClass](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md)  
 Describes various ways to refer to elements of a Visual Basic program.  
  
 [Visual Basic Limitations](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/limitations.md)  
 Discusses the removal of known coding limits within Visual Basic.  
  
## <a name="related-sections"></a>相关章节  
 [版式和代码约定](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/typographic-and-code-conventions.md)  
 Provides standard coding conventions for Visual Basic.  
  
 [编写代码](/visualstudio/ide/writing-code-in-the-code-and-text-editor)  
 Describes features that make it easier for you to write and manage your code.
