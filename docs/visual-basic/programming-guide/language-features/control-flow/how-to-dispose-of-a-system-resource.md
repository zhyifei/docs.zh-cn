# <a name="how-to-dispose-of-a-system-resource-visual-basic"></a>如何：释放系统资源 (Visual Basic)
You can use a `Using` block to guarantee that the system disposes of a resource when your code exits the block. This is useful if you are using a system resource that consumes a large amount of memory, or that other components also want to use.  
  
### <a name="to-dispose-of-a-database-connection-when-your-code-is-finished-with-it"></a>To dispose of a database connection when your code is finished with it  
  
1. Make sure you include the appropriate [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md) for the database connection at the beginning of your source file (in this case, <xref:System.Data.SqlClient>).  
  
2. Create a `Using` block with the `Using` and `End Using` statements. Inside the block, put the code that deals with the database connection.  
  
3. Declare the connection and create an instance of it as part of the `Using` statement.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Insert the following line at the beginning of your source file.  
    Imports System.Data.SqlClient  
    Public Sub AccessSql(ByVal s As String)  
        Using sqc As New System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection(s)  
            MsgBox("Connected with string """ & sqc.ConnectionString & """")  
        End Using  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
     The system disposes of the resource no matter how you exit the block, including the case of an unhandled exception.  
  
     Note that you cannot access `sqc` from outside the `Using` block, because its scope is limited to the block.  
  
     You can use this same technique on a system resource such as a file handle or a COM wrapper. You use a `Using` block when you want to be sure to leave the resource available for other components after you have exited the `Using` block.
